Welcome to Sek's Greedy Genome Assembler! This is a greedy assembler for short-read data that
receives input from fastq files and outputs a single assembled genome. The program will prompt you
for an input file name and assumes that the file is either in the directory this script is in or in
the user's Documents folder. Alternate locations can be defined in the ASM_CONFIG.yaml file. The
YAML file MUST be located in the same directory that this script resides or the script will assume
everything is in the same directory.

You've chosen --> ./data/ <-- as your assembly library.
You flagged --> ['f ', 'G'] <-- as your CLI options.

Input file names with extensions. Seperate files with commas. ~>
